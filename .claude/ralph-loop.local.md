I want you to create a clean, minimalistic but cute artsy landing page. Use /frontend skill.  It should have this logo in the center.            
  'c:/Users/user/Downloads/s-logo.jpeg'. Say coming soon... And have a spiral as a cursor. Use VITE or nextjs. Use /frontend skill. Also use the google chrome connection    
  self validate the output you get for UI using claude for chrom, and improve it till it is perfect. Say DONE when finished
